&lt;p&gt;After receiving &lt;a href="/blog/2017/03/toptal-grant"&gt;financial grant from Toptal&lt;/a&gt;, we are obliged to record our time spent on RVM. When seeking for the best time tracking software, we stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://timelyapp.com"&gt;Timely&lt;/a&gt;. It felt like the most convenient and good looking application, which perfectly suited our needs. Unfortunately, their free plan did not cover teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached out to &lt;a href="https://timelyapp.com"&gt;Timely&lt;/a&gt; and we are happy to announce that they agreed to sponsor us with a free lifetime account for RVM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much, Marius!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using the service for over a month we can confirm that it fully satisfied our needs. It's simple, fast and very user-friendly. If you looking for a time tracking tool, &lt;a href="https://timelyapp.com"&gt;Timely&lt;/a&gt; is definitely worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce that we received a financial grant from &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/#get-effective-engineers-today"&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt;, which would sponsor our work on RVM for the next 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/#get-effective-engineers-today"&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt; is an exclusive network of the top software developers, designers, and finance experts in the world.
Top companies rely on Toptal agile talent for their most important projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toptal will be contributing up to $100,000 in grants over the next year to help offset the cost of living for Toptalers contributing to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toptalers from all over the world and various levels of open source experience have applied for the program with very compelling projects and ideas. The applications were scored based on the impact that the project would have on the open source and remote communities, social good, and general public interest in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee has reached a final verdict on the first round of recipients and happily, RVM was part of the first round of financing amongst 3 other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
